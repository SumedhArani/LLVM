# LLVM-Basics
Implemented basic passes for-
1.Finding global variables
2.Function names
3.Number of basic blocks
4.Number of strongly connected components(Tarjan's algorithm)
5.Finding the hot fields in a struct for a given program
6.Profiling on loops by adding IR code to the source code and running the code at run time.
with the use of LLVM framework.

Shell scripts have been written to execute a set of commands to obtain the neccesary results!
You can find the shell script in /test_cases folder.

Suitable comments have been added to explain the code.
